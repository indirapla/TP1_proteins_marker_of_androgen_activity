#  Because the combination of different markers may improve the discriminative power 
#  to diagnose hypogonadism and predict its long term sequelae, proteins selected from 
#  the ROC-AUC analysis were included as predictors in a stepwise regression (method: backward) 
#  to select the best combination of markers that predict the odds of being low T. Bootstrap 
#  resampling with replacement method was applied to assess consistency of predictors selected 
#  with the stepwise regression.
